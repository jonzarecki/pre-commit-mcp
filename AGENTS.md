# Instructions for Codex agents

- Always run `pre-commit` on any files you modify. Use `pre-commit run --files <file1> <file2> ...`.
- Run `python3 -m py_compile fast_precommit_mcp/*.py` after code changes to ensure the project compiles.
- Commit the results of `pre-commit` and compilation before submitting a pull request.
